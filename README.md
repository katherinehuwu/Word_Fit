Word Fit empowers English language learners to expand their vocabulary repertoire. For any given Ted talk, 
Word Fit parses through the entire transcript to create a prioritized list of vocabulary. Each vocabulary 
is selected based on their academic level, usage frequency, and word complexity and accompanied with learning 
resources from Merriam Webster’s Dictionary and New York Times. It also generates vocabulary exercises and a 
personalized vocabulary list with data visualization to help users track their learning progress.
